# Secret Project

A Node.js-based web application that implements a simple authentication mechanism to grant or restrict access to a secret page. The app uses **Express.js** for the backend and is easy to deploy and use.

---

## Features

- **Password-based Authentication**: Verifies user access with a predefined password.
- **Custom Middleware**: Middleware to check authentication before granting access to secure pages.
- **Static File Support**: Serves static files like HTML pages for user interaction.
- **Node.js & Express.js**: Lightweight and efficient backend framework.
- **Modular Design**: Easy-to-understand file structure for scalability and modification.

## Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or above)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/secret-project.git
   cd secret-project
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

4. Open your browser and visit:

```

## How It Works

1. The user accesses the root route (`/`) which serves a login form (`index.html`).
2. The password entered in the form is sent to the server via a POST request.
3. The middleware function checks if the password matches the predefined one (`ILoveProgramming`):
   - **Correct Password**: Grants access to the secret page (`secret.html`).
   - **Incorrect Password**: Redirects back to the login page.

## Deployment

You can deploy this application on hosting platforms like **Render**, **Railway**, **Heroku**, or **Vercel**. See the [deployment guide](#) for details.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for the server.
- **Express.js**: Backend framework for routing and middleware.
- **HTML/CSS**: Static files for the frontend.
- **Body-Parser**: Middleware to parse form data.
